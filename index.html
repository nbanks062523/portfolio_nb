          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <p><br>In this project, a data pipeline is created with data from Kaggle and transformed in Visual Studio using Python. The datasets are stored in Google Big Query. Several visualizations were created in Google Looker Studio to show various metrics on NFL betting.</p>

          <h3>Project 2</h3>
          <p><br>In this project, Airflow was used to orchestrate a workflow that did the following: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that executes tasks to add CSV files to Google Cloud beginning with two functions that act as a checklist to ensure that the data files are properly placed and to ensure that the DAG is able to connect to the Big Query client </li>
            <li>The first 2 tasks of the DAG run the checklist functions, followed by an empty operator for branching the table creation tasks</li>
            <li>The next task runs a loop that loads each table</li>
            <li>Finally, another empty operator is used to bring the tasks back together</li>
          </ul>
          <p><br>As shown in the images, the following tables were created by the DAG: </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Food Inflation by month -</b> A table that shows the inflation rates of food by month year over year</li>
            <li><b>Grocery Prices by month -</b> A table that shows the price of groceries month over month by state</li>
            <li><b>SNAP Population, SNAP Poverty Population, SNAP Program Participants -</b> These tables display data around the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and its recipients over time by state</li>
